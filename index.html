   <p><strong>Electric Bike</strong></p>Electric mountain bikes are equipped with an electric motor that gives you additional power to your pedalling action to help you tackle any terrain and enjoy the ride. MTB fans are certainly beginning to realise the benefits of an electric mountain bike, as you get all the thrills you want from a normal MTB but with the extra power you need to get back to the top and give the trail another go. It means you can fit much more riding into one session. Or if you want to cover more distance (as often the best riding spots are quite far apart here in the UK) e mountain bikes are perfect for the job. All the usual MTB configurations are available – everything from wheel size to forks and more, and there’s the choice of hardtail or full suspension electric mountain bike too.</p>
